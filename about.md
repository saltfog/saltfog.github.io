#### Site Colophon

This site (blog) is a place I share my thoughts, opinions, reviews, ideas, projects or findings. This site is built with the excellent [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator and proudly hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with FREE. The layout of this site (Jekyll theme) is designed or hand-made by me with a passion of simplicity. Its typeface is powered by [Fira](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) from Mozilla.
